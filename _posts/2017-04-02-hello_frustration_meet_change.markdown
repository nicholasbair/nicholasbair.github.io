Five years ago, I was working for a mid-sized trucking company.  I had recently left a large multinational company, and was struggling to adjust to a culture where decisions were made without data.  Why the lack of data?  The system we were using was from the 1980's!

Much to my relief, later that year we transitioned to a newer ERP system.  Unfortunately, the new system was an immense disappointment--poor UX, very little automation, no mobile application. I articulated my frustrations to a friend who works in the software business, he said "if you are so opinionated about what makes good software, you should learn to program."  His comment started my journey to learn development, and in the beginning defined my motivation to learn.  

As of late, my motivations have changed--programming is the purest form of problem solving.  There may be an infinite number of solutions to a problem, but it is simple check if the problem has in fact been solved.  I enjoy being creative and analytical, solving problems, and building things.
