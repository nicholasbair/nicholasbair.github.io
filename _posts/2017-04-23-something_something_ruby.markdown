I think this blog post is supposed to be about CSS box styles--oops, I skipped over much of the CSS section to continue learning Ruby.  As my old boss used to say, "Work on what is interesting to you in this moment."

Previously, I learned JavaScript and had no reason to question it as my language of choice.  However, this morning I fired up the mac to work on a MERN project (Mongo, Express, React, Node).  Returning to the land of semi-colons and curly braces felt unnatural, if not clunky.  Maybe it is the implicit return in Ruby, or the robust standard library (looking at you, JavaScript + underscore), but I found myself struggling to write expressive code and longing for the elegence of Ruby.

I would have continued on programming in JavaScript, never knowing what I was missing if not for great courses at Flat Iron.  I had no reason to question my language choice, and certainly lacked the experience to completely disregard the compulsory click-bait articles titled something, something Ruby/Rails is Dead!
