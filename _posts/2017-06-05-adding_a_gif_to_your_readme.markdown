title:  Adding a GIF to your readme

For my Sinatra project I decided to add a gif of the app in the readme.  The idea is that if someone (ahem...prospective employer) were to check out the repository, how do I catch their eye?  How do I give them a good impression of the project with minimal effort on their part?

I downloaded a free gif capture software called [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/).  LICEcap provides a transparent pane that you can resize over the area you wish to capture.

When you press record, LICEcap will ask for a file name to save your gif, then start recording.  Hosting the gif is even easier.  I created an issue in my project repositoy, and drag/dropped the gif file into the body of the issue.  GitHub will replace the gif with an asset link which you can paste into your readme.  Closing the issue doen't appear to delete the gif.
